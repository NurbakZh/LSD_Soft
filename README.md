#Software for LSD Paper Project
Even if we have been writing Paper as a project, in this repo you can find:
* 2 python scripts(**_Repetition checker & Sentence Counter_**) which helps to find
and correct some common mistakes in our paper, and make it more readable and 
understandable for users.
* 1 HTML/CSS/JS based web-page with information about our project, future plans(_which now are past plans_).
Moreover, there is a link for downloading our Paper and anyone can read it from there
and leave and comments that they would like to leave, and it will be send to telegram
chat.
